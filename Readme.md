## The Qt in CrealityPrint
A Qt5.15.2-based Optimization Library for CrealityPrint.

## Project Overview
This library optimizes the CrealityPrint 3D printing software by addressing two critical issues:
1. QAccessible lagging: Disables QAccessible to reduce UI freezes.
2. Qt3D Rendering Crashes: Fixes thread-safety issues.
